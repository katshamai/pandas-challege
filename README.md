 Pandas homework
 
 3 observable trends from the data:
 
 1. While Heroes of Pymoli is more popular with male players, female players, on average, are more likely to spend more money on purchases within the game. This may indicate that popularity, from a gender perspective, may have little correlation to willingness to spend on in game purchases.
 
 2. While the 35-39 age group only accounts for 5.38% of total players, they are the highest spenders on average. The age group with the highest percentage of players was 20-24 (accounting for 44.79% of players) but they are only the third highest average spenders. This may indicate that it could be profitable for developers to invest in marketing to the 35-39 age group as they are willing to spend on in game purchases but currently only account for a small proportion of players.
 
 3. In general, the most popular items are also the most profitable for the developers. Out of the top 5 most profitable items, 3 are also
 in the top 5 most popular.
